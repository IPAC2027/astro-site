## American Physical Society (APS)

![APS Logo](/images/logos/sponsors/APS_logo.svg)

The [American Physical Society (APS)](https://www.aps.org) is a nonprofit membership organization working to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics through its outstanding research journals, scientific meetings, and education, outreach, advocacy, and international activities. APS represents more than 50,000 members, including physicists in academia, national laboratories, and industry in the United States and throughout the world. Society offices are located in College Park, MD (Headquarters), Ridge, NY, and Washington, DC.

**Division of Physics of Beams (DPB)**

The objective of the Division of Physics of Beams is the advancement and diffusion of knowledge regarding the nature and behavior of beams and the instruments for their production and use. It provides to its members, and to all members of the American Physical Society, an opportunity for coordination and a forum for discussion and communication.
