## IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society (NPSS)

The IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society is a transdisciplinary professional society that brings together engineers and scientists working in the fields of nuclear and plasma sciences and engineering.

### NPSS Mission

- Advance the theory and application of nuclear and plasma sciences
- Foster professional development in nuclear and plasma engineering
- Support international collaboration in accelerator science
- Promote the peaceful applications of nuclear technology

### NPSS and IPAC

NPSS has been instrumental in the development and success of the IPAC conference series since its inception. The society provides:

- Scientific oversight and quality assurance
- International networking and collaboration
- Technical program development
- Educational opportunities for early-career researchers

## American Physical Society (APS)

The American Physical Society is a non-profit membership organization working to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics through its outstanding research journals, scientific meetings, and education, outreach, diversity, and international activities.

### Division of Physics of Beams (DPB)
