**IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society**  
*Professional Society for Nuclear and Plasma Sciences*

The IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society is a transdisciplinary professional society that brings together engineers and scientists working in the fields of nuclear and plasma sciences and engineering.

### About the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. IEEE and its members inspire a global community to innovate for a better tomorrow through its more than 419,000 members in over 160 countries, and its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities. IEEE is the trusted "voice" for engineering, computing, and technology information around the globe.

### NPSS Mission

- Advance the theory and application of nuclear and plasma sciences
- Foster professional development in nuclear and plasma engineering
- Support international collaboration in accelerator science
- Promote the peaceful applications of nuclear technology
