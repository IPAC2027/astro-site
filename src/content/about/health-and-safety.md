## Attendee Health and Safety Guidelines

We look forward to seeing you at IPAC'27! The health and safety of all attendees is our primary goal. To ensure the well-being of all event participants, we have assembled the following guidelines to provide a safe and enjoyable experience.

## General Guidelines

As a general rule, please use common sense when traveling to and attending the event. If you need assistance at any time, please reach out to conference staff or the Local Organizing Committee.

## Before the Event

### Travel

Be sure to write down the name and contact information of the [event venue](/travel/venue-information) and your [hotel](/travel/accommodation).

**Share Your Plans**
- Advise a family member or friend of your travel plans, including the dates you will be gone, how you will travel to the meeting, and where you are staying
- Research your destination and review requirements for entry/exit, visa requirements, local laws, customs, medical care, etc.
- If traveling internationally, note the location of your home country's embassy or consulate
- Inform your bank and credit card companies of your travel plans and familiarize yourself with the local currency
- Keep medications in your carry-on luggage

### Safety

- Make at least two photocopies of all your travel documents (passport, driver's license, credit cards, etc.)
- Leave one copy with a trusted person at home and carry the other separately from your original documents
- Keep your passport separate from your wallet to avoid theft
- Do not carry your passport in your back pocket

### Health

The [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/) offers the following health guidance to help you prepare for your trip:
