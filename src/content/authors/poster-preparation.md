## Poster Preparation

* Each poster will be presented on a single board, whose dimensions are 100 cm (39.4 inches) wide x 200 cm (78.7 inches) high.
* We recommend preparing and printing a poster of size ISO A0 (84.1 cm x 118.9 cm) or US Arch E (36 in x 48 in) in PORTRAIT orientation on the board.

:::highlight
Avoid landscape orientation for the A0/Arch E formats, as it will be too wide to fit the poster boards.
:::

* The Conference Organizers will provide all necessary supplies for mounting the posters (tape, etc).
* Poster preparation guidelines are the same for the standard Poster Sessions and the Student Poster Session.
* The Scientific Program Committee reserves the right to reject publication of papers that have not been properly presented or manned in the poster sessions. 
* Manuscripts of your contributions to the proceedings (or enlargements of them) are not considered as posters, and papers presented in this way will not be accepted for publication.
* Please include [IPAC'27 Logo](/about/conference-logo) on the poster. 

## Poster display 

* Poster sessions are scheduled from Sunday to Thursday.  Each poster will be assigned a poster number
* Assigned poster boards will be ready each morning from 08:45. All presenters are asked to hang their posters as soon as possible in the same morning of their assigned poster session. This way all delegates will be able to study them ahead of the poster session and come prepared with specific questions.
* Presenters are also asked to remove their posters at the end of the session. Any poster left unmanned on its poster boards after 18:30 will be removed.
* Student 's poster will be assign a seperate poster number for Sunday's student poster session.
