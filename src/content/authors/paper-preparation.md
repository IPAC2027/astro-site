## Paper Templates

Each submitting author is asked to submit a paper following the paper preparation guidelines. Use of the [official JACoW templates](https://www.jacow.org/Authors/HomePage) is mandatory. Please Always download the latest version of the template ( $\LaTeX$, Word or OpenDocument) before starting to write a paper, even if you are an experienced author and/or have submitted a paper in a previous JACoW conference.  Please **do not reuse** the source files from previous papers to avoid use of possibly old template parts.
