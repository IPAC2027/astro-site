## Jacow Templates

Each submitting author is asked to submit a paper following the paper preparation guidelines. Use of the [official JACoW templates](https://www.jacow.org/Authors/HomePage) is mandatory. Please Always download the latest version of the template ( $\LaTeX$, Word or OpenDocument) before starting to write a paper, even if you are an experienced author and/or have submitted a paper in a previous JACoW conference.  Please **do not reuse** the source files from previous papers to avoid use of possibly old template parts.

:::grid{columns=3}
:::card{icon="TeX" styled-icon="true" title="$\LaTeX$ Template"}
The [latest Latex class](https://www.jacow.org/Authors/LaTeX) should be used.  You may also use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to avoid local installation.
:::

:::card{icon="W" styled-icon="true" title="MS Word Template"}
The [latest MS Word template](https://www.jacow.org/Authors/MSWord) should be used. Install the template (.dotx file) on your computer for best results.
:::

:::card{icon="OO" styled-icon="true" title="ODF Templates"}
The [latest OpenDocument (ODF) Templates](https://www.jacow.org/Authors/OpenDocument) should be used.

## Length of contributions
Papers for invited oral presentations may be up to 5 pages. Papers for both contributed oral and poster presentations may be up to 3 pages. If contributions contain numerous references, these may be carried over to an extra page. No other parts of the paper but references are allowed on this extra page.

:::highlight
Page limits will be strictly respected, all papers exceeding their limit will be returned to the author for revision or, at last, rejected.

## References
References are among the most frequent issues requiring editor intervention. Follow these rules:

1. All references must be numbered and listed in the “References" section at the end of the paper
2. In-text citations should appear as [3]
3. URLs can be included, but hyperlinks must be removed (In Word use Ctrl+K to remove).
4. Use exact formatting from the templates and JACoW website
5. “et al.” should be used when citing papers with more than 6 authors

### Reference Examples:
:::grid{column=1}
:::card{title="Presented at IPAC’27 (“this conference”)", width="1"}
[1] A. Author, et al., “Paper title”, presented at the 18th Int. Particle Accelerator Conf. (IPAC’27), Detroit, MI, USA, May 2027, paper XXXXXX, this conference.
