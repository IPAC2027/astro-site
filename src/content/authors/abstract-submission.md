:::card{icon="üé§" title="Contribution Type"}
Choose ‚Äú**Poster presentation**‚Äù for your submission. The Scientific Programme Committee will select a number of abstracts to be presented as oral contributions.

:::card{icon="üìÑ" title="Content"}
The description, or abstract text, is needed here. Please describe what you intend to present at this conference:
* Text should not exceed 1200 characters.

:::card{icon="üß∑" title="Footnotes/Funding Agency"}
Footnotes may not exceed 200 characters, so be judicious and concise in your use of references. Enter footnotes, or publications referenced by the asterisks in the Abstract Text field with a carriage return after each. Enter funding agency information in this field.

:::

:::card{icon="üè∑Ô∏è" title="Classification of Abstracts (tracks)"}
All contributions are grouped by Main and Sub Classification. It is authors‚Äô responsibility to properly classify their abstracts to ensure that, if accepted for presentation, the paper is properly placed within the conference programme. A description of the scope of the classifications is provided to help authors with this task (see the Main and Sub Classifications section).
:::

:::card{icon="üë¨" title="Entry of Co-authors"}
Please follow the JACoW page ["How to submit an abstract"](https://docs.jacow.org/General/submission/) to enter all your co-authors. Failure to do so will result in their exclusion from the author index in both the conference programme booklet and in the proceedings. 
:::

:::card{icon="üéØ" title="Presenter/Speaker Identification"}
It is assumed that the submitting author would present a paper for oral presentation if selected. The names of submitting authors/persons who will make oral presentations need to appear first in the list of authors in the programme and author index of the proceedings. If someone other than the submitting author will present the paper, this should be indicated on this page.
