## General requirements
* Slides should use the 16:9 aspect ratio.
* Presentations must be uploaded to Indico at least 8 hours before their scheduled time to allow verification and transfer to the conference A/V file server system.
* There will be no provision for authors to use their personal computers under any circumstances.
* Each invited Oral will take 25 mins + 5 mins for Q&A
* Each contributed Oral will take 15 mins + 5 mins for Q&A


After the presentations are uploaded to the conference server, they can be checked on the conference computers provided in the Speaker Ready Room.

Slides that have been successfully submitted and presented will be published in the web version of the proceedings without further notification from the conference organizers. If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the Indico system by the end of the conference.

If you have any special requirements regarding movies and/or audio, please visit the Speaker Ready Room prior to the presentation as early as possible.

## Preparation of slides

In addition to the presentation source file, we require a PDF file for inclusion in the conference proceedings.

In PDF, please ensure that all fonts are embedded. No external resources (like linked, not embedded, images) should be used.

## Upload of presentations

1. Speakers are required to upload their presentation in the same way as their paper contributions.

2. The files of the presentations should be uploaded to Indico as early as possible and no later than half a day before the presentation time. Files must be named with the programme code followed by “_talk”, for example: ```MOPA999_talk.pptx``` and ```MOPA999_talk.pdf```, and then uploaded through the IPAC’27 Indico “My Contributions” area.

3. Be sure to select “Slides” in the “Submit files” button under the Editing area  of your contribution as shown below.
